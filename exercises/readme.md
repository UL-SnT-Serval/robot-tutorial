# Exercises

# Goal

The purpose of these exercises is to practice at writing tests and acceptance criteria based on requirements. In the exercises are composed of a series of user stories that cover the buying experience of a customer visiting the e-commerce web portal of [SauceDemo from Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/). 

For each user story, you are asked to write one or more tests in order to fully cover each requirement. Remember, a requirement is not only covered by testing the happy path, think about alternative path, in other words, what could go wrong and how is it handled. If needed add the setup and teardown needed to achieve the best test isolation.

## Points to keep in mind

* How well the test are covering the requirement (Look at example 3 for the login)
* How comprehensible the test and the acceptance criteria are
* The proper separation of concerns in the Gherkin steps
* The isolation strategy used in the setup and teardown

# Prerequisite

* Robot Framework should be install on your machine as well as the Selenium2Library.
* An internet connection to access the remote website.
